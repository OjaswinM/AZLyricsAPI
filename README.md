# AZLyricsAPI
An API created for personal use using basic webscraping concepts in python3.

## Usage
Import the file and use the search() function with a string as an arguement. The string is expected to be a name of some song. The program saves the lyrics in __Artistname - Songname.txt__ format

## Issues
Code fails to work when AZLyrics returns albums and artists alongside with songs
