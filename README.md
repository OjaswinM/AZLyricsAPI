# AZLyricsAPI
An API created for personal use using basic webscraping concepts in python3. All scraped lyrics are property of [AZLyrics.com](https://www.azlyrics.com/) and is not to be used for any kind of usage which doesn't comply with their policies.

## Usage
Import the file and use the search() function with a string as an arguement. The string is expected to be a name of some song. The program saves the lyrics in __Artistname - Songname.txt__ format

## Issues
Code fails to work when AZLyrics returns albums and artists alongside with songs
